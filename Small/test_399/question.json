      "Rule1: Provided that the TheraCel project attracts significant public investment, it is the case that if the initial toxicity tests on the TheraCel compound are positive, then the TheraCel compound is not flagged for further in-depth safety review.",
      "Rule2: If a detailed project timeline for the TheraCel drug development is established, then it follows that if it is not the case that (successful pilot synthesis of the TheraCel compound leads to the TheraCel drug receiving regulatory approval), then the manufacturing process for the TheraCel drug is scaled up.",
      "Rule3: Either a detailed project timeline for the TheraCel drug development is established, or external consulting experts are hired by Aethelred Pharmaceuticals for project management.",

      "Rule8: If Phase 3 clinical trials for the TheraCel project are successfully completed, then the TheraCel compound is successfully synthesized at a pilot scale.",

      "Rule11: Should early clinical safety indicators for the TheraCel compound be inconclusive, then it means that if the initial toxicity tests on the TheraCel compound are positive, then the TheraCel compound is not flagged for further in-depth safety review.",
      "Rule12: Whenever the research team involved in the TheraCel project publishes a promising preliminary report, the TheraCel project attracts significant public investment.",
      "Rule13: If it is not true that (external consulting experts being hired by Aethelred Pharmaceuticals for project management leads to the situation where if it is not the case that (successful pilot synthesis of the TheraCel compound leads to the TheraCel drug receiving regulatory approval), then the manufacturing process for the TheraCel drug is scaled up), then the TheraCel drug is launched into the market.",
      "Rule14: If it is not the case that (successful completion of Phase 3 clinical trials for the TheraCel project leads to the TheraCel drug receiving regulatory approval), then the TheraCel drug receives accelerated review status.",
