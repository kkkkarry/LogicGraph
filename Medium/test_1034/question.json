      "Rule1: Under the condition that the sustainable technology project is research active, funding is secured for the sustainable technology project.",
      "Rule2: Whenever funding is secured for the sustainable technology project, then either data analysis is complete for plant growth data, or if the publication of forest research results does not imply the lack of a completed field study, forest research is peer reviewed.",
      "Rule3: There is an environmental disturbance at the forest site, or the forest habitat ecosystem is not stable.",
      "Rule4: Under the condition that the data collection protocol is followed, then if remote sensors are monitoring actively, there is no environmental disturbance at the forest site.",
      "Rule5: If the solar device collects data on plant growth, then whenever government funding is not available for clean technology, plant biology is a field of study in renewable energy.",
      "Rule6: If the research station is solar operational, then the solar device collects data on plant growth.",
      "Rule7: Provided that the research station is wind operational, the wind device collects data on plant growth.",
      "Rule8: If data integrity is verified for plant metrics, then whenever it is not the case that the absence of solar operational or wind operational at the research station implies backup power is active at the research station, the power system is not reliable at the research station.",
      "Rule9: Under the condition that the research findings are results reproducible, the research findings have valid conclusions.",
      "Rule10: If the field team is present at the research site, then the solar panel is an active sensor in the plant area, or the wind turbine is an active sensor in the plant area.",

      "Rule14: Under the condition that the methodology is approved by the research committee, then if the sustainable technology project is research active, either data analysis is complete for plant growth data, or if publishing the results of forest research does not lead to the negation of a completed field study, forest research is peer reviewed.",
      "Rule15: If a conference presentation is scheduled by the research committee, then publication is authorized by the research committee.",
      "Rule16: Provided that a patent is filed by the technology office, a conference presentation is scheduled by the research committee.",
