      "Rule4: The soil moisture sensor reading is either low or critical.",
      "Rule5: Given that the soil moisture sensor reading is critical, if the herb garden's moisture level being adequate does not imply the plant monitor is active, then the herb garden's irrigation system is triggered.",

      "Rule29: The coordination protocol is either primary or secondary.",
      "Rule30: If the coordination protocol is secondary, then given that the backup controller is the device coordinator, the smart fridge is an active device or the entertainment system is an active device.",
      "Rule31: Provided that a comprehensive network scan is performed, and the router is the network monitor, and neither the smart fridge nor the entertainment system is an active device, then the device network is not stable.",
      "Rule32: If a basic network scan is performed, and the router is the network monitor, and neither the smart fridge nor the entertainment system is an active device, then the device network is not stable.",
