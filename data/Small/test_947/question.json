      "Rule1: Provided that satellite data is received from the weather satellite, if it is not the case that the absence of data collection activity in the weather network implies a storm is approaching the coastal region, then coastal platforms are evacuated.",
      "Rule2: Either satellite data is received from the weather satellite or radar data is received from the weather radar.",
      "Rule3: Under the condition that severe weather is confirmed by the weather bureau, it is not the case that a false alarm is declared by the weather bureau.",
      "Rule4: If a public alert is issued by emergency services, then severe weather is confirmed by the weather bureau.",
      "Rule5: Either funding is approved by the research council or emergency funding is approved by the research council.",
      "Rule6: Under the condition that emergency funding is approved by the research council, if approval is obtained from the research director, then if it is not the case that radar data being received from the weather radar leads to the implication that the absence of data collection activity in the weather network implies a storm is approaching the coastal region, which then implies evacuating coastal platforms, a public alert is issued by emergency services.",
      "Rule7: If equipment is operational at the monitoring station, then it is not the case that equipment failure occurs at the monitoring station.",
      "Rule8: Whenever a hurricane warning is issued for the Atlantic region, the hurricane warning is canceled for the Atlantic region.",
      "Rule9: If a hurricane warning is issued for the Atlantic region, then it is not the case that the hurricane warning is canceled for the Atlantic region.",
      "Rule10: Either a hurricane warning is issued for the Atlantic region, or if it is not the case that the absence of data collection activity in the weather network implies a storm is approaching the coastal region, then coastal platforms are evacuated.",
      "Rule11: Provided that the monitoring system is activated on the weather platform, data collection is active in the weather network.",
      "Rule12: If drones are deployed from the weather platform, then data collection is active in the weather network.",
      "Rule13: If the research team is available at the meteorology institute, then a study of the hurricane phenomenon is initiated.",
      "Rule14: Either the research team is available at the meteorology institute or the emergency team is available at the meteorology institute.",
      "Rule15: Provided that the emergency team is available at the meteorology institute, drones are deployed from the weather platform.",
      "Rule16: Whenever a study of the hurricane phenomenon is initiated, instruments are secured on the research platform.",
      "Rule17: If it is not the case that securing instruments on the research platform leads to activating the monitoring system on the weather platform, then instruments are damaged on the research platform.",
      "Rule18: Under the condition that it is not the case that securing instruments on the research platform implies activating the monitoring system on the weather platform, it is not the case that instruments are damaged on the research platform.",
      "Rule19: Provided that it is not the case that radar data being received from the weather radar implies that the absence of data collection activity in the weather network implies a storm is approaching the coastal region, which then implies evacuating coastal platforms, a false alarm is declared by the weather bureau.",
      "Rule20: If it is not the case that initiating a study of the hurricane phenomenon leads to activating the monitoring system on the weather platform, then equipment failure occurs at the monitoring station.",
      "Rule21: Under the condition that it is not the case that the negation of the implication that funding being approved by the research council leads to approval obtained from the research director implying that it is not the case that radar data being received from the weather radar implies that the absence of data collection activity in the weather network implies a storm is approaching the coastal region, which then implies evacuating coastal platforms, which in turn leads to issuing a public alert by emergency services, implies a budget cut in the research department, then the hurricane study project is canceled.",
      "Rule22: Under the condition that data collection is not active in the weather network, it is not the case that a storm approaches the coastal region."
