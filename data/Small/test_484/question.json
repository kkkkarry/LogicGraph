      "Rule1: In the event that satellite data analysis is performed for the arctic region, if it is not the case that climate change detection leads to increased bear conflicts when food is insufficient, then an emergency meeting by the conservation board is scheduled.",
      "Rule2: Either satellite data analysis is conducted for the arctic region, or a ground survey of the arctic region is completed.",
      "Rule3: Whenever a ground survey of the arctic region is completed, if the implication from climate change detection to bear conflict increase under food insufficiency does not hold, an emergency meeting by the conservation board is scheduled.",
      "Rule4: Either a controlled burn is authorized for the forest region, or, if a fire risk assessment is done and the drought implication fails, an evacuation order is issued.",
      "Rule5: Either there is a cultural preservation concern for the indigenous group, or the archaeological site in the forest region is protected.",
      "Rule6: If the archaeological site in the forest region is protected, then a controlled burn is not authorized for the forest region.",
      "Rule7: Whenever the research permit for the scientist is denied, the scientist completes the field study.",
      "Rule8: Provided that the research permit for the scientist is denied, the scientist does not complete the field study.",
      "Rule9: Given that conservation measures for the brown bear are increased, the protected status of the brown bear is not maintained.",
      "Rule10: If the government is monitoring the forest region, then, unless either wildfire damage occurs or crop unhealthiness leads to migratory route vulnerability, restoration funding for the forest region is approved.",
      "Rule11: Whenever the community is monitoring the forest region, if it is not true that wildfire damage or crop impact causes migratory route vulnerability, restoration funding for the forest region is approved.",
      "Rule12: Either the monitoring system is active in the forest region, or the government is monitoring it, or the community is monitoring it.",
      "Rule13: Provided that the blueberry bush has an abundant berry harvest, the blueberry bush crop is healthy.",
      "Rule14: If alternative food sources, such as salmon berries, are available, then the blueberry bush crop is healthy.",
      "Rule15: In the event that the brown bear has sufficient food, either the blueberry bush has an abundant berry harvest or alternative food sources like salmon berries are available.",
      "Rule16: Provided that the conditional from cultural preservation concern to no controlled burn authorization does not hold, the research permit for the scientist is denied.",
      "Rule17: Under the condition that neither wildfire damage occurs nor crop unhealthiness causes migratory route vulnerability, restoration funding for the forest region is not approved.",
      "Rule18: If the implication from habitat assessment completion to sufficient food for the brown bear is not true, then the population of the brown bear is stable.",
      "Rule19: Whenever the conditional from habitat assessment completion to sufficient food does not hold, the population of the brown bear is declining.",
      "Rule20: Should it not be the case that either the conservation status has been reviewed or population decline implies instability, the protected status of the brown bear is maintained.",
      "Rule21: In the event that neither conservation status review nor the implication from population decline to instability holds, conservation measures for the brown bear are increased.",
      "Rule22: Provided that the brown bear does not have sufficient food, bear conflicts do not increase in human settlements.",
      "Rule23: Whenever the blueberry bush crop is not healthy, the migratory route of the tundra swan is not vulnerable."
