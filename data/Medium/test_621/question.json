      "Rule1: Either intelligence confirms Route Omega is clear, or if it is not the case that the completion of maintenance for Vehicle Beta leads to fuel availability for Convoy One resulting in mission success for Operation Gamma, then Operation Gamma is aborted.",
      "Rule2: Whenever weather conditions are good in Region Delta, visibility is clear in Region Delta.",
      "Rule3: Under the condition that visibility is clear in Region Delta, Base Alpha receives supplies.",
      "Rule4: If command has approved Operation Gamma, then the completion of maintenance for Vehicle Beta ensures that fuel availability for Convoy One leads to mission success for Operation Gamma.",
      "Rule5: Assuming local cooperation exists in Region Epsilon, the completion of maintenance for Vehicle Beta implies that fuel availability for Convoy One results in mission success for Operation Gamma.",
      "Rule6: Either hostile activity is occurring in Region Zeta, or if neither command approval for Operation Gamma nor local cooperation in Region Epsilon holds, then an emergency extraction is conducted for Convoy One.",
      "Rule7: Provided diplomatic clearance has been granted by Organization Alpha, safe passage on Route Omega ensures that hostile activity is absent in Region Zeta.",
      "Rule8: Either diplomatic clearance has been granted by Organization Alpha or a security escort is provided by Vehicle Charlie.",
      "Rule9: If air support is available from Vehicle Delta, then safe passage on Route Omega implies that hostile activity is not occurring in Region Zeta.",
      "Rule10: Either satellite coverage is present over Region Delta or a security escort by Vehicle Charlie ensures air support from Vehicle Delta.",
      "Rule11: If a backup generator is operational on Vehicle Alpha, then encrypted communications by Organization Beta imply that the failure of maintenance completion for Vehicle Beta to lead to fuel availability for Convoy One resulting in mission success for Operation Gamma causes Operation Gamma to be aborted.",
      "Rule12: Assuming a backup generator is operational on Vehicle Beta, encrypted communications by Organization Beta result in the scenario where the lack of maintenance completion for Vehicle Beta leading to fuel availability for Convoy One resulting in mission success for Operation Gamma leads to Operation Gamma being aborted.",
      "Rule13: If thermal imaging capability is equipped on Vehicle Delta, then night vision is equipped on Vehicle Charlie or a backup generator is operational on Vehicle Alpha or on Vehicle Beta.",
      "Rule14: Provided a repair team is available from Organization Delta, either medical support is available from Organization Gamma or the condition that maintenance completion for Vehicle Beta fails to lead to fuel availability for Convoy One resulting in mission success for Operation Gamma causes Operation Gamma to be aborted.",
      "Rule15: If Convoy One has departed, then the openness of the Northern Pass route ensures that Base Alpha receives supplies.",
      "Rule16: Under the condition that the enemy has been engaged in Region Beta, the enemy has been detected in Region Beta.",
      "Rule17: Either fuel is available for Convoy One or fuel has been transferred to Convoy One.",
      "Rule18: Provided fuel has been transferred to Convoy One, mission success is achieved for Operation Gamma.",
      "Rule19: If maintenance is complete for Vehicle Alpha, then fuel availability for Convoy One leads to mission success for Operation Gamma.",
      "Rule20: Either maintenance is complete for Vehicle Alpha or maintenance is complete for Vehicle Beta.",
      "Rule21: Provided the condition that maintenance completion for Vehicle Beta does not lead to fuel availability for Convoy One resulting in mission success for Operation Gamma, Operation Gamma is not aborted.",
