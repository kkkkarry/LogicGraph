      "Rule18: If the research team identifies a rare orchid, then the lab technician analyzes the rare orchid.",
      "Rule19: If the lab technician analyzing the rare orchid does not lead to the rainforest being conserved, then the rare orchid becomes extinct.",
      "Rule20: If neither the research team publishes a journal article nor the scenario where failure of the research team studying medicinal plants to conserve the rainforest leading to storm damage does not result in engineers repairing the research station, then the research team delays fieldwork.",

      "Rule23: If it is not the case that failure of the research team studying medicinal plants to conserve the rainforest leading to storm damage results in engineers repairing the research station, then the research team documents biodiversity.",
      "Rule24: If failure of the rainforest not being conserved leading to the water supply not being polluted not resulting in ecologists monitoring wildlife does not lead to the government not funding the conservation program, then the conservation program is expanded.",
